This is just a toy repo for playing around with OxCaml and trying out
the new features, and walking through the tutorials.

Current state of the tree:

- **docs:** has some snapshots of the OxCaml documentation to make it
  easier for models that don't like to read outside code to do
  something reasonable.

- **bin:** a benchmarking tool, which can be run by running ./bench.sh
  from the root

- **src:** all the experimental code. More details as to what file
  does what within each file, along with some TODOs there.
